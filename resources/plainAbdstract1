In low-risk patients , the zotarolimus-eluting stent has been shown to reduce rates of restenosis without increasing the risk of stent thrombosis. We compared the efficacy and safety of the zotarolimus-eluting stent versus the sirolimus-eluting stent in patients with coronary artery disease who were receiving routine clinical care with no direct follow-up.We did a single-blind, all-comer superiority trial in adult patients with chronic stable coronary artery disease or acute coronary syndromes , and at least one target lesion. Patients were treated at one of five percutaneous coronary intervention centres between January, 2006, and August, 2007. Computer-generated block randomisation and a telephone allocation service were used to randomly assign patients to receive the zotarolimus-eluting or the sirolimus-eluting stent . Data for follow-up were obtained from national Danish administrative and health-care registries. The primary endpoint was a composite of major adverse cardiac events within 9 months : cardiac death, myocardial infarction, and target vessel revascularisation . Intention-to-treat analyses were done at 9-month and 18-month follow-up. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00660478.1162 patients (1619 lesions) were assigned to receive the zotarolimus-eluting stent , and 1170 patients (1611 lesions) to receive the sirolimus-eluting stent . 67 patients (72 lesions) had stent failure, and six patients were lost to follow-up. All randomly assigned patients were included in analyses at 9-month follow-up; 2200 patients (94%) had completed 18-month follow-up by the time of our assessment. At 9 months, the primary endpoint had occurred in a higher proportion of patients treated with the zotarolimus-eluting stent than in those treated with the sirolimus-eluting stent ( 72 [ 6% ] vs 34 [ 3% ]; HR 2.15, 95% CI 1.43-3.23; p=0.0002). At 18-month follow-up, this difference was sustained ( 113 [ 10% ] vs 53 [ 5% ]; 2.19, 1.58-3.04; p<0.0001). For patients receiving the zotarolimus-eluting stent and those receiving the sirolimus-eluting stent , all cause-mortality was similar at 9-month follow-up ( 25 [ 2% ] vs 18 [ 2% ]; 1.40, 0.76-2.56; p=0.28), but was significantly different at 18-month follow-up ( 51 [ 4% ] vs 32 [ 3% ]; 1.61, 1.03-2.50; p=0.035).The sirolimus-eluting stent is superior to the zotarolimus-eluting stent for patients receiving routine clinical care.Cordis and Medtronic.
